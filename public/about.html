<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone. I am Wadi Nwe Aung from Myanmar, most people knowned as Burma. You can call me Nira. I am 25 years old Online Thai language instructor and a freelance Thai interpretor. I went to The Yangon University of Foreign Language and studied Thai Language there. </p>

<p>I am a amivert personality which means I become introvert in sometimes and be a extrovert in sometimes as well. But I do love to work with team. It makes me learn about thought and vision of other people in community.</p>

<p>As the world is changing and I noticed that AI and technology is playing a big role in our daily life, I started to curious and wanted to learn. And since I am a person who love challanges in life I decided to make myself become a web developer. Now I start learning what is html and wrote this website in html ONLY. </p>

<p>I hope writing code, creating websites and debugging will make me happy and rich at the same time in someday.</p>
