 <h2>My top 3 movies of 2568</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>The Red Envalope</h3>
 <p>It's a Thailand movie the release this year. It's quite look like a bl movie cause the two main characters in the movies are all man (and may be one is the gay, nooooo he's actually a gay 'carse he only have interest in guys!). And also the actors who play that two main roles are the knowed bl couple in Thailand and other foreign countries. Ofcourse I love them too. The story was about a wedding that happened between a gay ghost and a stright man. The movie was quite lovely and funny at the same time. I hope I can enjoy kind of movie again.

 <h3>A Million before grandma die</h3>
 <p>This is also a movie that made in Thailand. And also release this year and unbeliveablely the main character in this movie is aslo the one from red envalope who's named Bilkin. He's a good actor by the way. I was decided not to watch it at first because the storyline of this movie is about a grandson who want the money from grandma after she died. The main point is THE GRANDMA will die and the grandson will kinda regret about his previous thoughts. In my actual life, the movie release the time around my grandma passed away. I thought I won't be able to handle my emotions in some way. But I watch its after a half or year afteer she left me. It was a great movie. Making us to remember that people come and go, value the time when you are with the one you love cause when it's gone, it's gone. You will only need the light when it's bruning low. For note, ofcourse I did cry when watching it.</p>
 <h3>The coming soon</h3>
 <p>I'm sorry to tell you that I did't really watch my third movie for this year yet. Since I'm a series person, mostly watching the Koren, Chinese or Thailand series. But when I done watching my very third movie of the year, I'll come and write the review again here. So Still Tune and See ya!</p>
